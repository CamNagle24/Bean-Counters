# Bean-Counters
Operator overloading constructors to count bean objects using dynamic memory.

Dynamic Memory Management: Through the BeanCounter class, I learned to handle dynamic memory using constructors, destructors, and memory-releasing practices.

Operator Overloading: I explored how to properly implement and use overloaded operators like << for outputting the class's state and + for combining two class objects.

Memory Management: I applied the concepts of dynamic memory, learning how to allocate and deallocate memory efficiently to avoid memory leaks in object-oriented programming.

Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator: I learned to implement a copy constructor and assignment operator to handle deep copying of dynamically allocated memory.
